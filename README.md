# Boids Simulation

A simple 2D Boids simulation that models the flocking behavior of birds, fish, or other swarming creatures using three core rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

## Features
- Real-time 2D simulation of flocking behavior
- Visual representation of boid perception and movement

## How It Works
The Boids simulation is governed by three simple rules:
1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors (steering away from nearby boids)
2. **Alignment**: Steer towards the average heading of nearby boids
3. **Cohesion**: Move towards the average position of nearby boids

These rules combine to create realistic flocking behavior that emerges from local interactions.

## Future Improvements
- Obstacle avoidance for more complex navigation
- Predator-prey dynamics for more interesting interactions
- 3D implementation for enhanced realism
